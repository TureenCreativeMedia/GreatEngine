### About Great Engine
Great Engine is an official framework by Tureen built on Unity to create Great Flarp Birb games without needing to set up the frivolous mechanics beforehand.

It was mainly created because Tureen was tired of recreating the same framework for each Great Flarp Birb project and preferred to have a starting point that could be updated seperately from the main games.

Updates to Great Engine may cause development times to simmer if games made with Great Engine decide to port to later versions.

The GitHub is a shared place for the code to exist and be hosted, as well as debated in GitHub issues which makes them the perfect place to submit features for Great Engine.

### Usage
Great Engine's usage policy follows Apache 2.0, but when a game uses Great Engine it must specify **clearly** that it does in an unskippable location of the game such as the intro or on the published page.

Tureen must be credited - alternatively as Tureen Creative Media - on the published page if Great Engine/parts of Great Engine were used in your project or game.

 > "Published page" refers to the page the project or game was published to, such as itch.io, steampowered.com and other game sites.
