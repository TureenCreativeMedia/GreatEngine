### About Great Engine
Great Engine is an official framework by Tureen built with Unity to create Great Flarp Birb games without needing to set up the frivolous mechanics beforehand.

It was mainly created because Tureen was tired of recreating the same framework for each Great Flarp Birb project and preferred to have a starting point that could be updated seperately from the main games.

Updates to Great Engine may cause development times to simmer if games made with Great Engine decide to port to later versions of the framework.
